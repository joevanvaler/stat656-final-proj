# stat656-final-proj
This is the github repo for our final project for STAT656 at Purdue University. In this project, we perform a Bayesian analysis of NBA game data to determine how home court advantage and first-two-quarter scoring efficiency affect win probability.

Refer to Analysis.R for the bulk of the analysis, including the stan code and MCMC sampling.

game_gameinfo_gamesummary_linescore_filtered.csv is the filtered dataset for 2014-2022 regular seasons, and is the dataset for our analysis.
